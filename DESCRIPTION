Description: Calculate distances, build phylogenetic trees or 
    perform hierarchical clustering between the samples of a VCF or FASTA file.
    Functions are implemented in Java and called via rJava.
    Parallel implementation that operates directly on the VCF or FASTA file 
    for fast execution.
