\title{Perform Hierarchical Clustering and tree pruning on samples of VCF file}
\usage{
vcf2clusters(
    inputfile,
    threads = 2,
    ignoremissing = FALSE,
    onlyhets = FALSE,
    ignorehets = FALSE,
    cutHeight = NULL,
    minClusterSize = 1,
    extra = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputfile}{Input vcf file location (uncompressed or gzip compressed).}

\item{threads}{Number of java threads to use.}

\item{ignoremissing}{Ignore variants with missing data
(\code{./.} or \code{.|.})}

\item{onlyhets}{Only calculate on variants with heterozygous calls.}

\item{ignorehets}{Only calculate on variants with homozygous calls.}

\item{cutHeight}{Define cutHeight for tree cutting.
Default automatically defined.}

\item{minClusterSize}{Minimum size of clusters. Default 1.}

\item{extra}{Boolean whether to use extra parameters
for the \code{\link[dynamicTreeCut]{cutreeDynamic}}.}
}
\value{
A list of :
\itemize{
    \item \code{\link[stats]{dist}} distances object.
    \item \code{\link[base]{character} vector} of the generated
    phylogenetic tree in Newick format
    \item \code{\link[base]{character} vector} of the clusters.
    Each row contains data for a cluster, separated by space.
    The id of the cluster,
    the size of the cluster (number of elements)
    and the names of its elements,
    Cluster id 0 contains all the objects not assigned
    to a cluster (singletons).
    Example clusters output :
    \tabular{lllll}{
        0 \tab 3 \tab Sample1 \tab Sample2 \tab Sample3 \cr
        1 \tab 3 \tab Sample4 \tab Sample5 \tab Sample6 \cr
        2 \tab 2 \tab Sample7 \tab Sample8 \tab \cr
        3 \tab 2 \tab Sample9 \tab Sample0\tab \cr
    }
}
}
\description{
Performs Hierarchical Clustering on a distance matrix
calculated as in \code{\link[fastreeR]{vcf2dist}}
and generates a phylogenetic tree with
agglomerative Neighbor Joining method (complete linkage)
(as in \code{\link[fastreeR]{dist2tree}}).
The phylogenetic tree is then pruned with
\code{\link[dynamicTreeCut]{cutreeDynamic}} to get clusters
(as in \code{\link[fastreeR]{tree2clusters}}).
}
\details{
Biallelic or multiallelic (maximum 7 alternate alleles) SNP and/or INDEL
variants are considered, phased or not. Some VCF encoding examples are:

    \itemize{
        \item heterozygous variants : \code{1/0} or \code{0/1} or \code{0/2}
        or \code{1|0} or \code{0|1} or \code{0|2}
        \item homozygous to the reference allele variants : \code{0/0}
        or \code{0|0}
        \item homozygous to the first alternate allele variants : \code{1/1}
        or \code{1|1}
    }

If there are \code{n} samples and \code{m} variants, an \code{nxn}
zero-diagonal symmetric distance matrix is calculated.
The calculated cosine type distance (1-cosine_similarity)/2 is in the range
[0,1] where value 0 means completely identical samples (cosine is 1),
value 0.5 means perpendicular samples (cosine is 0)
and value 1 means completely opposite samples (cosine is -1).

The calculation is performed by a Java backend implementation,
that supports multi-core CPU utilization
and can be demanding in terms of memory resources.
By default a JVM is launched with a maximum memory allocation of 512 MB.
When this amount is not sufficient,
the user needs to reserve additional memory resources,
before loading the package,
by updating the value of the \code{java.parameters} option.
For example in order to allocate 4GB of RAM,
the user needs to issue \code{options(java.parameters="-Xmx4g")}
before \code{library(fastreeR)}.
